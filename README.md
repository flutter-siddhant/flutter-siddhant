## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

### 📱 Flutter

Flutter has been a game-changer in the world of cross-platform mobile app development. With its expressive UI and fast development capabilities, I have used Flutter to create visually stunning and performant mobile applications for both Android and iOS platforms. Its hot reload feature has significantly improved my development workflow, allowing me to iterate and experiment efficiently.

### ☕ Java
Java is the backbone of many enterprise-level applications and has been a fundamental part of my programming journey. With its robustness and portability, I have leveraged Java to build versatile applications, web services, and Android apps. The object-oriented nature of Java has honed my problem-solving skills and fostered a deeper understanding of software design principles.

### 💻 Operating Systems
Understanding the intricacies of operating systems is vital for any computer engineering enthusiast. I have worked extensively with various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. Through hands-on experience, I have delved into system administration tasks, shell scripting, and optimizing system performance.
